<p>This is my first Data Science project. From a very young age, I have had a keen interest in politics. So what better way to start my journey as an amateur Data Scientist to choose a topic that excites me. I have decided to learn various skills related to Data Science by working on this project. I shall keep updating this notebook with new content as I go through numerous video lectures on websites such as Datacamp and Udemy.</p><br><br>
